1.1 Algorithms

    Euclid's Algorithm:
        Given two positive integers m and n, find their
        greatest common divisor.
        >>> [Find remainder.] Divide m by n and let r be the remainder.
        >>> [Is it zero?] If r = 0, the algorithm terminates; n is the answer.
        >>> [Interchange.] Set m <- n, n <- r, and go back to step E1.

    The five features of an algorithm:
        1. Finiteness.
            An algorithm must always terminate after a finite number of steps.
        2. Definiteness.
            Each step of an algorithm must be precisely defined; the actions
            to be carried out must be rigorously and unambiguously specified
            for each case.
        3. Input
            An algorithm has zero or more inputs, i.e., quantities which are
            given to it initially before the algorithm begins.
        4. Output
            An algorithm has one or more outputs, i.e., quantities which have
            a specified relation to the inputs.
        5. Effectiveness
            An algorithm is also generally expected to be effective. All of the
            operations to be performed in the algorithm must be sufficiently
            basic that they can in principle be done exactly and in a finite
            length of time by a man using pencil and paper.
